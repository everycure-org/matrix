# Welcome to MATRIX

Welcome to the Matrix onboarding guide! This guide provides an introduction to the project and the codebase, and guides you through the process of setting up your local environment.

## What is MATRIX?

MATRIX is Every Cure's main pipeline for generating high-accuracy predictions of drug-disease pairs using an "all vs all" approach. The pipeline:
- Ingests and integrates data from multiple sources
- Builds a knowledge graph
- Creates embeddings and trains models
- Makes predictions on potential drug-disease treatments

Then continue through this onboarding journey.
