title: First Full Run
---

After completing first steps, you should be able to:

- Understand our Tech Stack on a high level
- Set up MATRIX environment on your machine
- Understand how config and kedro parameters work well together
- Run the Repurposing Pipeline with both fabricated data and sample of real data

In this section, we will focus on setting up your environment so that it's ready to run our pipeline e2e with real data. We will first cover **data access** and introduce our available releases, and then we will cover **docker setup** with instructions how to **run the pipeline e2e.**
