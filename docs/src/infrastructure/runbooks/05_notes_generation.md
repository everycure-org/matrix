title: Notes and Article Generation by AI
---

## Overview

This runbook outlines the cases in which notes and articles are generated. The golden rule is that notes and articles are generated only when there is a **major** or **minor** bump.

## Examples
Given that the latest minor release is v0.2.5:

1. **Major bump**  
    - New release: v1.0.0 (major bump). Notes and article generation are expected.
    
2. **Minor bump**  
    - New release: v0.3.0 (minor bump). Notes and article generation are expected.
    
3. **Patch bump**  
    - New release: v0.2.8 (patch bump). Notes and article generation are skipped.
    
4. **Patch downgrade**  
    - New release: v0.2.3 (patch downgrade). Notes and article generation are skipped.  
    - Heads up: If the release version order is v0.2.5 → v0.3.2 → v0.3.0, **v0.3.2** is considered a minor bump, as it is triggered first, and **v0.3.0** is considered a patch downgrade, as it follows v0.3.2.
    
5. **Major or minor downgrade**  
    - New release: v0.1.8 (minor downgrade). This is forbidden and prevented from `kedro submit`. The same applies to major downgrades.
The reason to forbid it is that it is 

- a bit weird: yes, the Python programming language allows it, but for good
  reasons. Whereas we might add bugfixes to older releases, all new feature
  development should continue from the latest official release.
- processing the commits and PRs that have lead to this intermediate release,
  while not taking into account features that were added "in the future"
  (relative to this intermediate release) is harder
- if a major or minor release would be created that isn't the latest, then the
  release notes and article of the already existing release would become
  unlogical, since they are written relative to the last official (major or
  minor) release. An intermediate (major or minor) release would need to mention
  contributions that were already included in the latest release, and would need
  to remove it from that one too.

## Best Practices

- Ensure all PRs are correctly labeled and titled before generating release notes.
- Review and update the release notes draft for clarity and completeness.
- Acknowledge all contributors to foster a collaborative environment.
