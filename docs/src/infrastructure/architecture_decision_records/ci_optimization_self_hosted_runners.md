# ADR: CI Optimization with GitHub Actions Self-Hosted Runners

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-03  
**Deciders**: Team AI Platform
**Technical Story**: [AIP-517] - Optimize CI process to reduce runtime from 50 minutes to 15 minutes

## Context and Problem Statement

Our CI/CD pipeline was experiencing significant performance bottlenecks that were impacting development velocity:

- **Sequential CI Execution**: CI jobs were running sequentially, with each PR waiting for previous PR's CI to complete
- **Long CI Duration**: Each matrix-ci run took approximately 30 minutes to complete
- **Queue Accumulation**: With multiple PRs, CI wait times could extend to almost 2 hours
- **Resource Inefficiency**: GitHub-hosted runners required downloading and installing dependencies on every run
- **Development Friction**: Long CI times were blocking PR merges and slowing development cycles

The root cause was a combination of:

1. Sequential execution model where CI jobs queued behind each other
2. Cold-start overhead on GitHub-hosted runners (Python setup, dependency installation, Docker setup)
3. Limited concurrency with shared GitHub-hosted runner pools

## Decision

We decided to implement GitHub Actions self-hosted runners on our GKE cluster using Actions Runner Controller (ARC) with the following architecture:

### 1. Auto-Scaling Self-Hosted Runners

- Deploy ephemeral runners (one pod per job) for reliability
- Auto-scale from 0 to 50 runners based on GitHub Actions queue
- Use e2-standard-8 instances (8 vCPUs, 32GB RAM) for right-sizing

### 2. Custom Runner Images

- Build custom GitHub runner images with pre-installed dependencies:
  - Python 3.11 via pyenv
  - Java OpenJDK 17
  - Build tools (make, gcc, development libraries)
  - Docker-in-Docker support
- Host images in Google Artifact Registry for fast startup

### 3. Parallel CI Architecture

- Enable parallel execution of CI jobs across multiple runners
- Remove sequential dependencies between PR CI runs
- Implement matrix strategy for parallel test execution within jobs

## Consequences

### Positive

‚úÖ **Performance Gains**:

- **50% reduction in CI time**: From 30 minutes to ~15 minutes per CI run
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple PRs can run CI simultaneously without queuing
- **Fast startup**: Pre-installed dependencies eliminate cold-start overhead

‚úÖ **Development Velocity**:

- No more 2-hour CI queues during peak development periods
- Faster feedback loops for developers
- Reduced PR merge bottlenecks

‚úÖ **Cost Optimization**:

- Scale-to-zero when no jobs are queued (0 runners idle cost)
- Right-sized instances (e2-standard-8) for optimal price/performance
- Reduced overall GitHub Actions minutes consumption

‚úÖ **Reliability & Security**:

- Ephemeral runners (fresh pod per job) prevent cross-contamination
- Docker-in-Docker support maintains full Docker capabilities
- Dedicated node pools with proper taints and tolerations

### Negative

‚ö†Ô∏è **Operational Overhead**:

- Additional infrastructure to maintain (ARC controller, runner images)
- More complex troubleshooting compared to GitHub-hosted runners
- Need to manage custom runner image updates

‚ö†Ô∏è **Resource Management**:

- Need to monitor and tune auto-scaling parameters
- Potential for resource over-provisioning during peak usage
- Docker storage management in ephemeral environments

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**:

- Docker Compose compatibility issues (workaround: use `docker run`)
- Dependency on GKE cluster availability
- Custom image maintenance burden

### Technical Debt

üîß **Monitoring & Observability**:

- Need comprehensive monitoring of runner health and performance
- Cost tracking and optimization analysis
- Performance metrics collection for continuous improvement

üîß **Documentation & Training**:
