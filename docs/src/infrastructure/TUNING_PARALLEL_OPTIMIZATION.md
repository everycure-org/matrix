# Parallel Hyperparameter Optimization Implementation

## Overview

The `GaussianSearch` tuner has been updated to support parallel evaluation of hyperparameter configurations using scikit-optimize's `Optimizer` class with the ask/tell pattern.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `tuning.py`

**Previous Implementation:**

- Used `gp_minimize` which evaluates hyperparameter configurations sequentially
- 20 model fits ran one after another

**New Implementation:**

- Uses `Optimizer` with `ask`/`tell` pattern
- Enables parallel evaluation of multiple hyperparameter configurations simultaneously
- Respects the `n_jobs` parameter from the underlying estimator (e.g., XGBoost)
- When `n_jobs=-1`, multiple configurations are evaluated in parallel using `joblib.Parallel`

### 2. Key Features

- **Adaptive Parallelization**: Automatically detects `n_jobs` from the estimator
  - If `n_jobs=-1`: Evaluates multiple hyperparameter configs in parallel
  - Otherwise: Falls back to sequential evaluation
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Still uses Gaussian Process for intelligent hyperparameter search

  - `base_estimator="GP"`: Gaussian Process surrogate model
  - `acq_func="gp_hedge"`: Adaptive acquisition function selection
  - `acq_optimizer="lbfgs"`: L-BFGS for acquisition function optimization

- **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing configuration files

### 3. Configuration

**✅ Recommended: Keep `n_jobs=-1` in your config**

No changes required to `xg_ensemble.yml`. The tuner now automatically:

1. Detects `n_jobs=-1` from the XGBoost estimator
2. **Intelligently adjusts** it to avoid resource contention
3. Balances parallel hyperparameter search with parallel tree building

**What Happens with 88 CPUs:**

```yaml
estimator:
  _object: xgboost.XGBClassifier
  n_jobs: -1 # You specify this
  # ... other params
```

The tuner automatically:

- Calculates: `n_parallel_evals = √88 ≈ 9` → rounds to 4 (safe range: 2-4)
- Adjusts XGBoost: `n_jobs = 88 / 4 = 22 threads per model`
- Evaluates: 4 hyperparameter configs in parallel, each using 22 threads
- Result: Full CPU utilization (4 × 22 = 88) without contention

### 4. Performance Impact & Intelligent CPU Allocation

**Before:**

- 20 hyperparameter trials × 1 CV split = 20 sequential XGBoost fits
- Each fit uses all CPU cores for tree building

**After (Intelligent CPU Allocation):**

The tuner automatically balances outer (hyperparameter) and inner (tree building) parallelism to avoid resource contention:

**Strategy:**

- Detects available CPUs (e.g., 88 CPUs)
- Calculates optimal parallel evaluations: `√(n_cpus)` ≈ 2-4 configs in parallel
- Allocates remaining threads to each XGBoost: `threads_per_model = n_cpus / n_parallel_evals`
- Example with 88 CPUs:
  - 4 hyperparameter configs evaluated in parallel
  - Each XGBoost uses 22 threads (88 / 4)
  - Total CPU usage: 4 × 22 = 88 (full utilization, no contention!)

**Why Not Parallelize Everything?**

If we naively evaluated many configs in parallel, each with `n_jobs=-1`:

- 88 configs × 88 threads = 7,744 threads competing for 88 CPUs
- Massive context switching and memory overhead
- Actually **slower** than sequential execution!

**Results:**

- Estimated speedup: 2-4× faster for the tuning phase
- Optimal CPU utilization without resource contention
- Lower memory pressure compared to full parallelization

## Testing

Added `test_gaussian_search_parallel()` to verify:

- Parallel evaluation works correctly
- Best parameters are found and within bounds
- Convergence plot is generated
- Compatible with sklearn's cross-validation splitters

## Example Usage

```python
from matrix.pipelines.modelling.tuning import GaussianSearch
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
from skopt.space import Real, Integer

# Create estimator with n_jobs=-1 for parallel evaluation
estimator = XGBClassifier(n_jobs=-1, random_state=42)

# Define search space
dimensions = [
    Real(name='learning_rate', low=0.01, high=0.5),
    Integer(name='max_depth', low=3, high=10),
]

# Create tuner (will automatically use parallel evaluation)
tuner = GaussianSearch(
    estimator=estimator,
    dimensions=dimensions,
    scoring=lambda y_true, y_pred: f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='macro'),
    splitter=StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, test_size=0.1, random_state=42),
    n_calls=20
)

# Fit - will evaluate multiple configs in parallel
tuner.fit(X, y)

# Get best parameters
print(tuner.best_params_)
```

## Notes

- The implementation uses `joblib.Parallel` which respects the MATRIX project's existing parallelization patterns
- Gaussian Process surrogate model training is still sequential (required for Bayesian optimization)
- This change primarily speeds up the expensive model evaluation step
- For datasets with long training times, the speedup will be more noticeable

# Why Not Run All 20 Trials in Parallel?

## TL;DR

Running all 20 trials at once would **hurt performance** because:

1. ❌ Breaks Bayesian optimization (no learning between trials)
2. ❌ Would need 20 × 37 = 740 threads competing for 111 CPUs
3. ❌ Memory explosion (20 XGBoost models in RAM simultaneously)
4. ❌ Actually slower due to resource contention

The current approach (3 at a time) is **optimal**! ✅

## Understanding Bayesian Optimization

### What Makes It Smart

Bayesian optimization **learns** from previous trials:

```
Trial 1-3:   Random exploration
Trial 4-6:   "Hmm, high learning_rate + low max_depth seems good"
Trial 7-9:   "Let me try variations around that region"
Trial 10-12: "Found an even better combo!"
Trial 13-20: "Refining the best region..."
```

### If We Run All 20 at Once

```
Trial 1-20: All random (no learning!)
```

This degrades to **random search** instead of intelligent Bayesian optimization.

## The Math: Why 3 Parallel Is Optimal

### Current Approach (3 Parallel)

```
Iteration 1: Evaluate configs 1, 2, 3 in parallel (3 × 37 = 111 CPUs)
            GP learns from results
Iteration 2: Evaluate configs 4, 5, 6 in parallel (informed by 1-3)
            GP learns from results
Iteration 3: Evaluate configs 7, 8, 9 in parallel (informed by 1-6)
            ...and so on

Total: ~7 iterations of learning
Result: Converges to optimal hyperparameters quickly
```

### If We Did 20 Parallel

```
Iteration 1: Evaluate all 20 configs (20 × 37 = 740 threads on 111 CPUs!!!)
            - Massive resource contention
            - Context switching overhead
            - Memory pressure (20 models in RAM)

Total: 1 iteration, no learning
Result: Like throwing darts blindfolded
```

## Performance Analysis

Let's assume each model takes **T** seconds to train:

### Current (3 parallel, Bayesian learning)

```
Time: 7 iterations × T = 7T
Quality: High (intelligent search finds good params early)
Effective: Often finds optimal in 10-15 trials → ~5T actual time
```

### Sequential (1 at a time)

```
Time: 20 iterations × T = 20T
Quality: High (full Bayesian learning)
```
