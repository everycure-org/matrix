!!! "Prerequisites"
    Before onboarding to the Matrix Platform, we highly recommedn completing the first steps and first full run sections of getting started guide to get a full understanding of the pipeline.
    
    You can use this [onboarding issue](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/new?assignees=&labels=onboarding&projects=&template=onboarding.md&title=%3Cfirstname%3E+%3Clastname%3E) to help you navigate the onboardingset-up.

In order to run Matrix pipeline using our platform and cluster, you will need to onboard onto the Matrix Project. For this, get in touch with us _via_ GitHub Issues.

Once that's completed, you can proceed to the [GCP setup](../getting_started/deep_dive/gcp_setup.md) for linking your local environment with the project. You should then get access to our GCS buckets with releases and intermediate data products.
