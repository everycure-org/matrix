    "The main conclusions are that there is very likely a data leakage being encoded in the embeddings and our GraphSage is likely not optimized towards the most informative topological embeddings. Data leakage is definitely not drastic and not 100% confirmed, as we can see clear effect of topological enrichment (when we compare Chunyus embeddings), nevertheless there is definitely large room for improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**GraphSage Examination** To be able to assess quality of embeddings (ignore the data leakage for now) on actual downstream performance, we need to make sure that topological enrichment with GraphSage behaves as it did for Chunyu's publication. Therefore my next step is to optimize GraphSage implemented in Neo4j (current pipeline) and see if we can optimize to to yield the same results. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Node2vec Examination** Node2vec is not based on LLMs and can be used to create useful graph embeddings. To examine potential data leakage (as well as other alternatives to GraphSage) we could train node2vec and see how our model performs. We need to note that node2vec doesnt utilize attribute embeddings and focuses only on graphs connectivity which has both advantages and disadvantages.\n",
