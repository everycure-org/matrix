## Pipeline framework: Kedro

!!! info
    Kedro is an open-source framework to write modular data science code. We recommend checking out the [introduction video](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/introduction/index.html).

We're using [Kedro](https://kedro.org/) as our data pipelining framework. Kedro is a rather light framework, that comes with the following [key concepts](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/get_started/kedro_concepts.html#):

1. __Project template__: Standard directory structure to streamline project layout, i.e., configuration, data, and pipelines.
2. __Data catalog__: A lightweight abstraction for datasets, abstracting references to the file system, in a compact configuration file.
3. __Pipelines__: A `pipeline` object abstraction, that leverages `nodes` that plug into `datasets` as defined by the data catalog[^1].
4. __Environments__: [Environments](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/configuration/configuration_basics.html#configuration-environments) allow for codifying the execution environment of the pipeline.
5. __Visualization__: Out-of-the-box pipeline visualization based directly on the source code.

Kedro project directory can be found in `pipelines/matrix` directory with an associated `README.md` with instructions.

[^1]: Kedro allows for fine-grained control over pipeline execution, through the [kedro run](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/nodes_and_pipelines/run_a_pipeline.html) command.

### Data layer convention

Data used by our pipeline is registered in the _data catalog_. To add additional structure to the catalog items, we organise our data according to the following convention:

1. __Raw__: Data as received directly from the source, no pre-processing performed.
2. __Intermediate__: Data with simple cleaning steps applied, e.g., correct typing and column names.
3. __Primary__: Golden datasets, usually obtained by merging _intermediate_ datasets.
4. __Feature__: Primary dataset enriched with features inferred from the data, e.g., enriching an `age` column given a `date-of-birth` column.
5. __Model input__: Dataset transformed for usage by a model.
6. __Models__: Materialized models, often in the form of a pickle.
7. __Model output__: Dataset containing column where model predictions are ran.
8. __Reporting__: Any datasets that provide reporting, e.g., convergence plots.


!!! tip
    We name entries in our catalog according to the following format:

    `<pipeline>.<layer>.<name>`

### Dataset transcoding

Our pipeline uses Spark and Pandas interchangeably. To avoid having to manually convert datasets from one type into another, Kedro supports [dataset transcoding](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-training/blob/master/training_docs/12_transcoding.md).

In short, this feature allows for defining multiple flavors of a dataset in the catalog, using the syntax below. The advantage of this is that Kedro is aware that `my_dataframe@spark` and `my_dataframe@pandas` refer to the same data, and hence pipeline runtime dependencies are respected.


```yaml
my_dataframe@spark:
  type: spark.SparkDataSet
  filepath: data/02_intermediate/data.parquet
  file_format: parquet

my_dataframe@pandas:
  type: pandas.ParquetDataSet
  filepath: data/02_intermediate/data.parquet
```

### Data fabrication

!!! tip
    For more information regarding the fabricator, navigate to `pipelines/matrix/packages/data_fabricator`.

Our pipeline operates on large datasets, as a result the pipeline may take several hours the complete. Unfortunately, large iteration time leads to decreased developer productivity. For this reason, we've established a data fabricator to enable test runs on synthetic data.

To seamlessly run the same codebase on both the fabricated and the production data, we leverage [Kedro configuration environments](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/configuration/configuration_basics.html#configuration-environments).

!!! warning
    Our pipeline is equipped with a `base` and `cloud` catalog. The `base` catalog defines the full pipeline run on synthetic data. The `cloud` catalog, on the other hand, plugs into the cloud environment.

    To avoid full re-definition of all catalog and parameter entries, we're employing a [soft merge](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/configuration/advanced_configuration.html#how-to-change-the-merge-strategy-used-by-omegaconfigloader) strategy. Kedro will _always_ use the `base` config. This means that if another environment is selected, e.g., `cloud`, using the `--env` flag, Kedro will override the base configuration with the entries defined in `cloud`. Our goal is to _solely_ redefine entries in the `cloud` catalog when they deviate from `base`.

The situation is depicted below, in the `base` environment our pipeline will plug into the datasets as produced by our fabricator pipeline, whereas the `cloud` environment plugs into the cloud systems. Note that these commands need to be run in `matrix/pipelines/matrix` with the virtual environment activated.

```bash
# Pipeline uses the base, i.e., local setup by default.
# The `test` pipeline runs the `fabricator` _and_ the full pipeline.
kedro run -p test -e test

# To leverage cloud systems, however note that we should never run env cloud locally
kedro --env cloud
```

### Dependency injection

At the end of the day, data science code is very configuration heavy, and is therefore often flooded with constants. Consider the following example:

```python
def train_model(
    data: pd.DataFrame,
    features: List[str],
    target_col_name: str = "y"
) -> sklearn.base.BaseEstimator:

    # Initialise the classifier
    estimator = xgboost.XGBClassifier(tree_method="hist")

    # Index data
    mask = data["split"].eq("TRAIN")
    X_train = data.loc[mask, features]
    y_train = data.loc[mask, target_col_name]

    # Fit estimator
    return estimator.fit(X_train.values, y_train.values)
```

While the code above is easily generalizable, its highly coupled to the `xgboost.XGBClassifier` object. We leverage the [dependency injection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dependency-injectiondi-design-pattern/) pattern to declare the `xgboost.XGBClassifier` as configuration, and pass it into the function as opposed to constructing it within. See the example below:

```yaml
# Contents of the parameter file, were indicating that
# `estimator` should be an object of the type `sklearn.base.BaseEstimator`
# that should be instantiated with the `tree_method` construction arg.
estimator:
    object: xgboost.XGBClassifier
    tree_method: hist
```

```python
# inject_object() recorgnizes configuration in the above format,
# and ensures that the decorated function receives the instantiated 
# objects.
from refit.v1.core.inject import inject_object

@inject_object()
def train_model(
    data: pd.DataFrame,
    features: List[str],
    estimator: sklearn.base.BaseEstimator, # Estimator is now an argument
    target_col_name: str = "y",
) -> sklearn.base.BaseEstimator:

    # Index data
    mask = data["split"].eq("TRAIN")
    X_train = data.loc[mask, features]
    y_train = data.loc[mask, target_col_name]

    # Fit estimator
    return estimator.fit(X_train.values, y_train.values)
```

```python
def create_pipeline(**kwargs) -> Pipeline:
    return pipeline(
        [
            node(
                func=train_model,
                inputs=[
                    ...
                    "params:estimator", # Pass in the parameter
                    ...
                ],
                ...
            ),
            ...
        ]
```

The dependency injection pattern is an excellent technique to clean configuration heavy code, and ensure maximum re-usability.

### Dynamic pipelines

!!! note 
    This is an advanced topic, and can be skipped during the oboarding.

!!! tip 
    Dynamic pipelining is a rather new concept in Kedro. We recommend checking out the [Dynamic Pipelines](https://getindata.com/blog/kedro-dynamic-pipelines/) blogpost. This pipelining strategy heavily relies on Kedro's [dataset factories](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/data/kedro_dataset_factories.html) feature.

Given the experimental nature of our project, we aim to produce different model flavours. For instance, a model with static hyper-parameters, a model that is hyper-parameter tuned, and an ensemble of hyper-parameter tuned models, etc.

Dynamic pipelines in Kedro allow us to do exactly this. We're defining a single pipeline skeleton, which is instantiated multiple times, with different parameters. The power here lies in the fact that our compute infrastructure now executes all these nodes in isolation from each other, allowing us to train dozens of models in parallel without having to think about compute infrastructure. We simply execute the pipeline and compute instances get provisioned and removed dynamically as we need them, greatly reducing our compute operational and maintenance overhead.

The above visualisation comes from [kedro viz](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-viz) which we greatly recommend trying out to get a sense of the entire pipeline.
