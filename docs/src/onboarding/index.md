## Communication 

### Slack for communications

We use slack channels for day 2 day communication. These channels are prepared to all:

- **matrix-wg-data-kg:** Data and KG working group
- **matrix-wg-modelling:** Modelling and Evaluation working group
- **matrix-wg-validation:** Validation working group
- **matrix-all:** Matrix wide chat
- **matrix-interesting:** Matrix wide interesting information to share. Used for papers, external sources etc that are worth sharing
- **matrix-updates:** Updates chat for sharing regular structured updates from each WG

You can create your own of course, although it would be great if we can keep the communication transparent 

In terms of our communication principles, we utilize threads within our discussions to keep conversations organized and to ensure that everyone involved can easily follow along. If we need to specifically address someone, we tag them directly. This method helps in maintaining a clear line of communication and ensures everyone's thoughts are heard and accounted for. However, we are also mindful of avoiding any unnecessary noise within the channel. To this end, we avoid using "at channel" or similar blanket notifications unless absolutely necessary, so as not to disturb everyone with irrelevant information. This way, we can maintain a productive and respectful communication environment.

### Documentation and Information Sharing

- Documentation is in markdown, we use [mkdocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for structuring our documentation + use Drawio for drawings using `drawio.svg` extension
- For other file types, use Google Drive. E.g. for Powerpoint or Excel files. You can also use Google Collabs to share collaborative notebooks with each other if helpful.

### Calls & Digital Whiteboarding

We use Slack and Zoom for our communication. Either huddles or Zoom calls. Ad hoc whiteboarding can be easily done with [excalidraw.com](http://excalidraw.com).
