# Walkthrough: New Model

This use case follows a hypthetical scenario where Maya, an independent researcher contributing to Matrix, has implemented a new machine learning model for predicting drug-disease efficacy scores. We will walkthrough the steps Maya needs to take to go from developing the model to generating predictions.
