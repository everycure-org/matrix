## Breaking Changes üõ†

* **Switch to k-fold cross-validation:** The modelling pipeline now uses k-fold cross-validation for more robust model evaluation.  This significantly changes the output structure of the modelling and evaluation pipelines. (#683)
* **Refactor to remove the refit library:** The refit library has been removed, changing the way object injection and schema validation are implemented. (#811)
* **Refactor: Change the data pipeline's output format to KGX:** The data release pipeline now outputs data in KGX format, a change requiring adjustments to downstream pipelines. (#743)


## Exciting New Features üéâ
