### Breaking Changes üõ†

None in this release.

### Exciting New Features üéâ

- **LiteLLM Gateway Deployment**: Comprehensive deployment of LiteLLM as a unified LLM gateway on Kubernetes with Redis caching, PostgreSQL persistence, and support for multiple model providers (OpenAI GPT-5 family, Claude models). This provides centralized model access control, usage tracking, and cost management for the entire MATRIX platform [#1845](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1845)

- **Multi-Model Pipeline Support**: Added capability to run multiple models in parallel within the pipeline, enabling comparative experiments and ensemble approaches. This significantly expands experimental flexibility for model evaluation [#1843](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1843)

- **PrimeKG Integration**: Integrated PrimeKG as a new knowledge source, expanding the diversity of biomedical knowledge available for drug repurposing analysis. Includes data ingestion, validation, and dashboard visualization support [#1793](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1793)

- **Pipeline Run Branching**: Introduced `--from-run` CLI option allowing pipeline runs to branch from existing runs by reusing their output datasets as inputs. This enables efficient experimentation without re-running expensive upstream computations [#1769](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1769)

- **GitHub Actions Self-Hosted Runners**: Deployed self-hosted GitHub Actions runners on Kubernetes using Actions Runner Controller (ARC), providing dedicated CI/CD compute resources with Docker-in-Docker support for improved pipeline execution times and cost optimization [#1812](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1812)

## Release Highlights

### Infrastructure & Platform Maturity

This release represents a significant step forward in MATRIX's infrastructure maturity with the deployment of LiteLLM as a centralized LLM gateway and self-hosted GitHub Actions runners. These additions provide better cost control, improved monitoring, and faster CI/CD execution.

### Knowledge Graph Expansion

The integration of PrimeKG as a third major knowledge source (alongside RTX-KG2 and ROBOKOP) substantially expands the biomedical knowledge available for drug repurposing predictions. The updated baseline model now leverages embeddings from the integrated multi-source knowledge graph.

<!-- TODO: Data Science team should add a summary of the integrated KG baseline model performance improvements compared to single-source embeddings -->

### Developer Experience Improvements

The new `--from-run` capability enables much more efficient experimentation by allowing researchers to branch from existing pipeline runs without recomputing expensive upstream steps. This dramatically reduces iteration time for model development and hyperparameter tuning.

### Dashboard & Visualization Enhancements

The KG dashboard received substantial improvements including cross-release statistics, better performance through simplified queries, and enhanced visualizations with custom EChart network graphs.
