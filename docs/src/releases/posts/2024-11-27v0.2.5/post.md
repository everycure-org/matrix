# `v0.2.5`: First stable integrated KG release, improving ROBOKOP integration, first version of Matrix CLI, and enhancing pipeline control

This release of the Matrix Platform focuses on improving developer experience and enhancing data integration and pipeline control.  We introduce a new command-line interface (CLI), integrate the ROBOKOP
knowledge graph, and provide more granular control over pipeline execution.

## How to get access to the data published in this release

!!! info
    All the below commands assume you are checking out the `main` branch of the Matrix repository. To make sure you get a specific release, you can either check out the specific release tag or set the `RELEASE_NAME` environment variable to the release you want to use. When checking out the tag, you also get the codebase from that release. When you set the `RELEASE_NAME` environment variable, you get the data from the release, but the codebase of your current branch.

### Using the CLI

The quickest way to explore the data is using IPython:

```bash
kedro ipython --env cloud
```

This will start an IPython session with the following variables automatically loaded:
- `context`: The Kedro project context
- `catalog`: The data catalog containing all datasets
- `parameters`: Project parameters

You can then load any dataset using:

```python
df = catalog.load("dataset_name")
```

### Using Jupyter Notebook

To explore the data in a Jupyter notebook:

```bash 
kedro jupyter lab --env cloud
```

This will start a Jupyter server with the Kedro context loaded. The same variables (`context`, `catalog`, `parameters`) will be available in your notebook.

To reload the Kedro context at any time in your notebook (e.g. after changing configurations), use:

```python
%reload_kedro
```

#### Specifying a Different Release

By default, the data access will use the release specified in `conf/cloud/globals.yml`, to use a different release:

1. Update the `RELEASE_NAME` in `.env`:

```
RELEASE_NAME=v0.2.5-rtx-only #to use a release that only includes RTX data
```

!!! tip: 
    If you want to get a list of all current releases, while we are working on a more centralized solution you can run either `git tag` to see a list (data available starting from `v0.2.5`) or by running
    ```
    gsutil ls gs://mtrx-us-central1-hub-dev-storage/kedro/data/releases/
    ```

    which lists the folder containing all release runs. Note that not every folder will contain all data today, but we are working towards making sure they will always contain a complete release.

2. Reload your kedro context for the changes to take effect

### Via BigQuery

Simply navigate to the [BigQuery console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?inv=1&invt=Abitqg&project=mtrx-hub-dev-3of&ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1smtrx-hub-dev-3of!2srelease_v0_2_5_rc1)
and select the release you want to explore.

### When developing a new kedro node 

We would recommend building a clean python function in a notebook which consumes the
datasets of interest (e.g. `integration.prm.filtered_nodes`). When you are happy with the
function, you can copy it into the right place in the pipeline (various `nodes.py` files in `pipelines/matrix/src/matrix/pipelines/`) and wire it up with the rest of the pipeline using the syntax shown in various `pipeline.py` files.


For a complete list of changes, please refer to the [GitHub release notes](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/releases/tag/v0.2.5).

## Other Enhancements üöÄ

### 1. ROBOKOP Knowledge Graph Integration üåê

The platform now integrates the ROBOKOP knowledge graph, significantly expanding the scope and depth of our knowledge base. This integration enhances data coverage and provides richer context for drug
repurposing analysis, potentially leading to more accurate and comprehensive predictions.

### 2. Translator-Based Synonymization Enhancements üîÑ

The synonymization system, now powered by the [Translator project](https://nodenorm.test.transltr.io/docs#/translator), has undergone significant enhancements. These improvements ensure greater consistency and scalability in mapping drug and disease synonyms,
improving the overall quality and reliability of data integration by more accurately finding identifier equivalences.

### 3. GPU Support ‚ö°Ô∏è

The platform now leverages GPUs on the cluster, accelerating computationally intensive tasks.  Additionally, the integration of Neo4j Enterprise license keys unlocks advanced features and performance
optimizations for graph database operations. These infrastructure upgrades significantly improve the platform's efficiency and scalability.  See issue [#622](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/#622) for more details.

### 5. Matrix CLI ‚å®Ô∏è

A new command-line interface, `matrix-cli`, streamlines various project tasks. The CLI offers a centralized interface for managing GitHub users and teams, generating release notes with AI assistance, and
summarizing code changes. This simplifies common workflows and improves developer productivity.

!!! tip:
    This CLI is very early in development, and we would love to hear from you if you have any feature requests or feedback.
    Try it by switching to `apps/matrix-cli`, and running `uv run matrix`

### 6. Enhanced `kedro submit` Command  ‚öôÔ∏è

The `kedro submit` command has been significantly enhanced, providing developers with more fine-grained control over pipeline execution. It now supports running pipelines from specific nodes and submitting
to different buckets (test/release), enabling greater flexibility in development, testing, and deployment workflows. See issues [#605](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/#605) and [#611](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/#611) for more details.

### 7. Kedro Catalog Cleanup üßπ

Addressing technical debt, this release includes fixes for missing and unused entries in the Kedro catalog (issue [#600](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/#600)).  This cleanup improves pipeline reliability and maintainability.  Further improvements
to the catalog include fixes related to cloud globals (issue [#694](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/#694)) and more robust handling of node category selection during integration (issue [#654](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/#654)).

### 8. Enhanced Developer Experience üß∞

Several improvements streamline the developer experience:

- **Argo Workflow Submission Enhancements:** Improved Argo workflow submission (issue [#565](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/#565)) simplifies pipeline orchestration and execution.
- **BigQuery Integration Enhancements:**  Improvements to BigQuery integration through GCS filesystem datasets and external table registration (issue [#563](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/#563)) streamline data loading and access.
- **Developer Namespaces:**  Introduction of developer namespaces (issue [#605](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/#605)) improves resource isolation and facilitates parallel development efforts.  This is accompanied by a fix to a critical issue in
the Neo4j template (issue [#684](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/#684)).
- **BTE-TRAPI & Redis Integration:** The BTE-TRAPI deployment now integrates Redis for enhanced performance and caching (issue [#605](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/#605)).
- **ArgoNode Wrapper:**  The introduction of the ArgoNode wrapper (issue [#626](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/#626)) allows for greater customization of task execution and resource allocation within Argo Workflows.
- **Partitioned Dataset Embeddings:**  Implementation of efficient embedding computation using PartitionedDataset, batch processing, and LangChain integration (issue [#642](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/#642)) improves performance for
large-scale embedding generation.

### 8. Ongoing Modelling Workstreams

We have progressed the following workstreams: 

 - Successfully completed a first run of our supervised mechanism of action algorithm. This should provide greater transparency into our model predictions ([#510](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/510). We are also building an MVP for visualizing these MoA paths. 
 -  We have developed a first version of adding timestamps to the edges, and now have ~27% timestamped. This should enable us to execute more robust time-split-validation experiments in the future. ([#588](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/588))
 - Work to compare performance of existing models with TxGNN has made significant progress and our first experimental runs are now complete. Ongoing work will compare this method with our baseline KGML-xDTD approach. ([#586](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/586))
- We now have the ability to perform multiple folds of cross validation in the modeling and evaluation suite. This should enable us to better estimate stability and confidence in our model predictions ([#587](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/587))
- We have implemented the ability to run a full comparison of treat scores using various embedding models, such as Node2Vec, PubmedBERT, and OpenAI ([#301](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/issues/301).




## Next Steps üîÆ

We are continuously working to improve the Matrix Platform. Our next steps include further enhancements to the data release pipeline for fully automated releases, ongoing integration of new knowledge graphs,
exploring self-hosted LLMs for embedding generation, and preparing for open-sourcing the repository.
