# Matrix `v0.2.6`: Streamlining Data Releases and Enhancing KGX Processing

This release of the Matrix Platform focuses on improving the data release process, enhancing dependency management, and refining aspects of the development workflow. Key improvements include automated release tagging, improved KGX format generation, and updated dependencies.

## Key Enhancements

### Automated Release Tagging and Branching

The GitHub Actions workflow for creating release pull requests (`create-release-pr.yml`) now automatically tags the triggering commit and creates a dedicated release branch. This automation eliminates manual steps and streamlines the release process. The release version and Git reference are now extracted using `jq -r` for improved reliability and error prevention.

```yaml
release=$(echo '${{ toJson(github.event) }}' | jq -r '.client_payload.release_version')
gitref=$(echo '${{ toJson(github.event) }}' | jq -r '.client_payload.git_fingerprint')
# ... later in the workflow ...
git tag --annotate --message '' -- "${{env.release}}" "${{env.gitref}}"
git switch -c release/${{env.release}}
```

### Enhanced KGX Format Generation

The `filtered_edges_to_kgx` and `filtered_nodes_to_kgx` functions in `data_release/nodes.py` have been refactored to use a more generalized `create_kgx_format` helper function.  This improves code modularity, maintainability, and simplifies the logic for creating KGX formatted data. The `join_array_columns` function has also been optimized for improved performance when joining multiple array columns.

```python
def create_kgx_format(df: DataFrame, cols: Collection[str], model: Type[DataFrameModel]):
    return join_array_columns(df, cols=cols).select(*cols_for_schema(model))
```

### Improved Modularity and Maintainability

Pull Request #838 breaks down the data release node logic into more modular components, further enhancing code organization, testability, and maintainability. This change contributes to a more robust and easier-to-maintain data release pipeline.


### Dependency Updates

Several dependencies in `requirements.txt` have been updated to their latest versions, including `aiobotocore`, `aiosignal`, `attrs`, `botocore`, and others. These updates incorporate bug fixes, performance enhancements, and security improvements from the newer versions. Developers should ensure their local environments are updated accordingly.

```diff
-aiobotocore==2.15.2
+aiobotocore==2.16.0
-certifi==2024.8.30
+certifi==2024.12.14
-openai==1.57.0
+openai==1.58.1
```

### Technical Enhancements and Bug Fixes

- `BuildDataReleaseSensorWithReleaseVersion.yaml` now uses  `\` before closing curly braces in JSON payloads to improve readability and prevent YAML parsing issues.
- The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file now excludes the `docs/src/onboarding/` directory from formatting checks. This suggests ongoing documentation improvements related to onboarding.
- A minor change in `data_release/pipeline.py` modifies the output of the `last_node` from a single string to a list of strings, likely for consistency or compatibility.
- The `cols_for_schema` function in `schemas/knowledge_graph.py` now utilizes a more precise type hint for the `schema_obj` argument, improving code clarity and static analysis.

##  Modeling Pipeline Walkthrough

A new walkthrough on building modeling pipelines within the MATRIX Kedro pipeline has been added (PR #757). This documentation enhancement simplifies the process of creating and integrating new modeling pipelines into the project.


## Next Steps

The team will continue to refine the data release process, enhance documentation, and explore opportunities to further improve the platform's performance and scalability.  Future releases will focus on enhancing modeling capabilities, integrating new data sources, and providing more advanced evaluation metrics.
