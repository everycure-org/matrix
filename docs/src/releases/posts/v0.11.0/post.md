## Exciting New Features üéâ

- **Multi-Model Training Pipeline**: Added support for training multiple models in a single pipeline run, enabling comprehensive model comparison and selection workflows. Configure models via the new `models` parameter in the modelling configuration. [#1843](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1843)

- **LiteLLM Gateway Infrastructure**: Deployed LiteLLM as a unified API gateway for managing multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) on Kubernetes. Includes Redis caching, PostgreSQL for analytics, and comprehensive admin/user documentation. [#1845](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1845)

- **PrimeKG Integration**: Integrated PrimeKG as a new knowledge source into the MATRIX pipeline. PrimeKG provides precision medicine knowledge with 129K nodes and 4M+ edges covering diseases, drugs, proteins, and biological pathways. [#1793](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1793)

- **Branching from Previous Runs**: Added `--from-run` CLI parameter enabling pipeline execution to pull specific inputs from a previous pipeline run, allowing efficient branching and iterative experimentation without recomputing earlier pipeline stages. [#1769](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1769)

- **KG Release Trends Dashboard**: Created interactive dashboard page showing knowledge graph statistics and trends across MATRIX releases, providing insights into KG growth and evolution over time. [#1830](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1830)

- **Interactive Knowledge Source Network Graph**: Replaced static knowledge source flow diagram with custom ECharts-based interactive network visualization, enabling dynamic exploration of primary knowledge sources and their relationships. [#1837](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1837)

- **Edge Predicate Navigation**: Added comprehensive edge predicate pages to KG dashboard with links to individual predicate statistics, counts, and examples. [#1809](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1809)

- **Validator Library for Data Integrity**: Created `matrix-pandera` library with reusable validation framework for ensuring data quality across ingestion, fabrication, and processing pipelines. [#1853](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1853)

- **Inject Library for Cross-Repository Code Reuse**: Extracted dependency injection utilities into standalone `matrix-inject` library for sharing configuration patterns across MATRIX repositories. [#1853](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1853)

- **Benchmark Release Link**: Added link to benchmark release page from KG dashboard. [#1827](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1827)
