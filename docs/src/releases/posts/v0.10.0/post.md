### Breaking Changes üõ†

- **Migration to UV Package Manager**: Major dependency management overhaul replacing requirements.txt with UV workspace. This introduces a new workspace structure with individual libraries (`matrix-auth`, `matrix-fabricator`, `matrix-gcp-datasets`, `matrix-mlflow-utils`) extracted from the main pipeline. This change improves dependency isolation and build times but requires developers to use `uv sync` instead of `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
  [#1768](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/pull/1768)

### Exciting New Features üéâ

- **Enhanced Validation for Fabricator Pipeline**: Added comprehensive data validation to the fabricator pipeline using Pandera schemas, improving data quality assurance and early error detection during synthetic data generation
