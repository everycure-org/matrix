## Bugfixes 🐛

- **Fix/enable docker build from gh actions:** Resolved an issue where the Docker image was not being pushed correctly from GitHub Actions.  The `stream_output` parameter in `run_subprocess` was modified to `False`.

## Technical Enhancements 🧰

- **Make Pandera class agnostic:** Refactored code to remove Pandera dependency, improving flexibility and reducing potential conflicts. Replaced Pandera with a custom solution for schema validation that works with both Pandas and PySpark DataFrames. This involved significant changes to multiple files, notably within the `pipelines/matrix/src/matrix` directory.
- **Periodically run kedro kg-release:** Updated the cron job for the Kedro pipeline to run at a new schedule (15:20 CET on the 1st day of the month and on Tuesday instead of 10:25 CET).
- **Increased data size for fabricator:** Increased the number of rows generated by the `fabricator` for various datasets (rtx_kg2, clinical_trials, ec_medical_kg, and robokop).  This change is in `pipelines/matrix/conf/base/fabricator/parameters.yml`.
- **Refactored integration transformers:** Updated the structure of integration transformers to improve organization and maintainability. The previous `matrix.pipelines.integration` modules were moved into a new `matrix.pipelines.integration.transformers` directory and the folder structure was modified to use separate files for each transformer.  This improved the structure of the codebase.
- **Refactored normalizers:** Moved the normalizer code into a dedicated directory, and removed the abstract base class. The new structure of the normalizers is found within the `pipelines/matrix/src/matrix/pipelines/integration/normalizers` directory.

## Documentation ✏️

- **reverse sort by release version in Release History docs:** Fixed the sorting of releases in the documentation to be in reverse chronological order (newest first).

## Other Changes

- **Simplified Kedro pipeline submission:** Renamed the Kedro pipeline workflow file from `submit-kedro-pipeline.yml` to `periodically-run-kedro-kg-release.yml`. Minor changes to git commit message and the removal of unnecessary `git status` commands.
- **Updated release aggregated YAML:** Removed outdated release information from `releases_aggregated.yaml` file.  The order of the releases was also changed.
