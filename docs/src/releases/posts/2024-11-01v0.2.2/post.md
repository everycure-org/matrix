# `v0.2.2`: Enhanced Data Integration, Robust Synonymization, and Advanced Evaluation

This release of the Matrix Platform introduces improvements to data integration,
synonymization capabilities, and evaluation methodologies, enhancing the platform's
ability to generate drug repurposing predictions based on different selections of base data.
It also allows the ad-hoc generation of predictions for specific drugs or diseases.

For a complete list of changes, please refer to the [GitHub release notes](https://github.com/everycure-org/matrix/releases/tag/v0.2.2).

## Key Enhancements ðŸš€

### 1. ROBOKOP Data Integration and RTX 2.10 Upgrade :material-database:

The platform now integrates the ROBOKOP knowledge graph, significantly broadening the
knowledge base for drug repurposing analysis.  This integration, coupled with the upgrade
to RTX 2.10, delivers:

- **Enhanced data coverage:** A richer and more up-to-date knowledge graph for broader insights.
- **Improved prediction accuracy:** Leveraging the combined power of RTX 2.10 and ROBOKOP enhances the reliability of predictions.

### 2. Translator project based synonymization ðŸ”—

The synonymization system has been overhauled, replacing the previous ARAX based implementation with a more scalable solution hosted by the translator project.

- **Improved data consistency:** More precise mapping of drug and disease synonyms for better data integration. The API is able to synonymize more nodes and node types.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline Integration:** Synonymization is now part of the preprocessing pipeline, streamlining the data preparation process.

### 3. Advanced Evaluation Methodologies ðŸ“ˆ

This release introduces key advancements in evaluation methodologies:

- **Time-split Validation:**  Evaluating model performance on data separated by time provides a more realistic assessment of predictive power and reduces the risk of overfitting.
- **Recall@N Metric:** This new metric offers a more granular performance analysis, enabling threshold-based evaluation and a deeper understanding of model behavior.
- **Node2Vec Integration:** Complementing the existing GraphSAGE implementation, Node2Vec enhances topological embedding generation, leading to more robust predictive modeling.
- **Redesigned Evaluation Framework:**  The evaluation framework has been redesigned to integrate seamlessly with the matrix generation pipeline and provide improved reporting, including matrix integration
and enhanced reporting.

### 4. Matrix Generation Pipeline ðŸš§

A new matrix generation pipeline has been implemented, providing a streamlined process for generating drug-disease prediction matrices. Key features include:

- **Enhanced reporting:** Detailed statistics and metrics provide greater transparency into the prediction process.
- **Drug-disease fabrication:** Facilitates the creation of synthetic data for testing and validation.
- **Drug-stratified train/test split:** A robust 8/1/1 train/test/validation split stratified by drug ensures balanced representation and reduces bias in model training.

### 5. Data Release Pipeline ðŸ“¤

The introduction of a data release pipeline provides a structured process for managing
and distributing knowledge graph snapshots, enabling experimentation with different data
releases and improving reproducibility. This also includes splitting the knowledge graph
for experimental purposes. 

This pipeline is still under development and we aim to fully automate KG snapshot
releases over the next 2 months to reach a weekly patch and monthly minor release
cadence using fully automated workflows.

### 6. Infrastructure and Tooling Enhancements ðŸ› 

Several improvements streamline development and deployment workflows:

- **`make` and Onboarding Improvements:** Enhancements to the `make` targets and onboarding documentation streamline developer setup and project contribution.  A `make clean` target simplifies environment cleanup.
- **Documentation Expansion:** Comprehensive documentation has been added for various aspects of the platform, including data science methodology, onboarding procedures, GraphSAGE comparison experiments,
Node2Vec experiment results, and running Argo Workflows locally.  The README now directs users to the documentation page for easier access.
- **`--from-env` Kedro Option:**  Enables reading data from different environments using the `--from-env` option with the `kedro run` command, enhancing flexibility during development and testing.
- **Kedro Submit Feature:**  Simplifies end-to-end pipeline execution on the current branch using the `kedro submit` feature. This feature will become more powerful going forward, allowing developers to submit workflows from their machine to our shared cluster for execution. 
- **Neo4J Enterprise License Keys:** Enables access to enterprise features of Neo4J. We leverage this mainly for hosting several KG versions on a single server as well as using many CPU cores for the GDS library which is usually limited to a parallelism of 4.
