# `v0.2.6`: Robust Model Evaluation with Cross-Validation, Flexible Ensembling, and Streamlined Pipelines

This release of the Matrix Platform focuses on enhancing model robustness, flexibility, and pipeline efficiency.  Key improvements include the implementation of k-fold cross-validation, a flexible ensemble model aggregation function, significant refactoring for improved code maintainability, and numerous bug fixes.

## Enhanced Model Evaluation and Flexibility

This release introduces major improvements to model evaluation and ensemble flexibility:

* **K-fold Cross-Validation (#683):**  Model evaluation is significantly more robust with the implementation of k-fold cross-validation. This generates multiple train-test splits, providing a more comprehensive assessment of model performance and generalization ability.  This feature enables more reliable comparisons between different models and configurations.

* **Flexible Ensemble Aggregation (#905):** A new parameter allows users to specify the aggregation function for ensemble models. This offers greater control over how predictions from individual models are combined, leading to improved performance and customization. The documentation provides details on how to leverage this new functionality.

## Pipeline Improvements and Refactoring

Several changes streamline the pipelines and improve code quality:

* **Refactoring to Remove `refit` Library (#811):** Removing the `refit` library simplifies dependencies and reduces maintenance overhead, making the codebase cleaner and easier to manage.

* **Simplified Neo4j SSL Setup (#878):**  Configuring Neo4j with SSL is now easier and more secure, improving the setup process for both developers and users. The documentation reflects these changes.

* **`argo_node` Refactoring (#885):**  Replacing the `argo_node` function with the `ArgoNode` class improves code structure and organization, promoting better readability and maintainability.

* **Consistent `pyspark.sql` Usage (#923):**  Standardizing the use of `pyspark.sql` throughout the codebase enhances consistency and clarity, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

* **Modelling Cleanup - Unify Splits (#907):**  The modelling process is streamlined by unifying split generation, improving code clarity and consistency.

## Bug Fixes and Stability Enhancements

Several bugs were addressed in this release, contributing to improved stability and reliability:

* **`wipe_neo` Script Protocol Fix (#899):**  Correcting the protocol used in the `wipe_neo` script improves Neo4j interaction and resolves potential issues.

* **Improved Kedro Hooks Test Coverage (#900):**  Increased test coverage for Kedro hooks enhances release stability and reliability.

* **Schema Error Fix in `ingest_nodes` (#943):**  Resolving a schema error related to null values in the `name` column of the `ingest_nodes` function ensures data integrity.

* **Release Branching Fix (#950):** Addressing an issue with release branch creation ensures consistency in release management and prevents potential errors.

## Documentation and Onboarding Improvements

The documentation received significant updates, making it easier for new users to get started and for existing users to find the information they need:

* **Updated Release Creation Documentation (#940):**  Clearer instructions on how to create a release simplify the release process and improve consistency.

* **Kedro Resources Documentation (#919):**  Adding documentation for Kedro resources helps users understand and leverage this feature effectively.

* **Onboarding Fixes and Key Management (#883, #886, #902, #904):**  Improvements to onboarding documentation and key management streamline the process for new contributors.

* **Updated Java Version Documentation (#903):**  Clarifying the required Java version (17) prevents compatibility issues and ensures a smooth setup process.

* **Added `libomp` Library to Installation Documentation (#934):**  Including the `libomp` library in the installation instructions ensures that all necessary dependencies are installed.

* **Updated Virtual Environment Documentation (#906):**  Clearer instructions on setting up a virtual environment simplify the development process.

* **Simplified Neo4J SSL Setup Documentation (#878):**  The documentation now reflects the simplified Neo4j SSL setup process.

* **Ensemble Model Aggregation Function Documentation (#905):**  The documentation now includes information on how to use the new flexible ensemble aggregation function.

## Other Changes and Technical Enhancements

Several other changes and technical enhancements improve code quality and project management:

* **Renaming `object` Keyword (#922):**  Renaming the `object` keyword improves readability and avoids potential conflicts.

* **Refactored Test Suite (#930):**  Improving the structure and maintainability of the testing suite makes it easier to ensure code quality and identify potential issues.

* **Added Import Sorting (#931):**  Consistent import sorting improves code readability and maintainability.

* **Added Release Trigger Label to Argo (#936):**  Adding labels to Argo workflows to indicate data release triggers enhances monitoring and tracking.

* **Rendering Release Info in Docs (#858):**  This feature makes release information more accessible to users.


This release strengthens the Matrix Platform by improving model robustness, flexibility, and code maintainability.  The addition of cross-validation and flexible ensembling significantly enhances model evaluation and customization. The various refactoring efforts, bug fixes, and documentation updates contribute to a more stable, reliable, and user-friendly platform.
