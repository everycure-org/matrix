Welcome to the Matrix Project! This documentation provides an introduction to the project and the codebase, and guides you through the process of setting up your local environment.

!!! info
    Please note that MATRIX project is still work in progress; whilst we already actively use the pipeline for finding promising repurposing candidates, . Therefore, if you discover any typos, bugs, tech debts, please let us know throguh issues (TODO: add link to create an issue) or through PRs - we appreciate all contributions and believe that by open-sourcing this not-yet finished repo, we can create a really great drug repurposing platform.

<details> <summary> Podcast summary before you dive in </summary>

  In this episode of "Infinite Loops," Dr. Grant Mitchell, a medical doctor with numerous qualifications, discusses his company Every Cure and its mission to utilize AI for drug repurposing. He explains that many existing drugs, particularly off-patent ones, have the potential to treat a vast number of diseases, but traditional pharmaceutical companies lack the incentive to explore these possibilities. Mitchell shares the motivating story of how he and his co-founder, David Fagenbaum, who survived a rare disease through drug repurposing, founded Every Cure to systematically unlock the potential of existing drugs using artificial intelligence.

  The conversation delves into the innovations and strategies employed by Every Cure, including constructing a comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph and using AI to identify repurposing opportunities. Mitchell emphasizes the importance of combining AI with clinical expertise to efficiently repurpose drugs and help patients quickly. He also highlights Every Cure's nonprofit model, which facilitates collaboration and open data sharing to maximize the impact of their research. Through significant philanthropic support and a strategic agreement with ARPA-H, Every Cure aims to save millions of lives by bringing effective treatments to neglected diseases, demonstrating a powerful intersection of technology, medicine, and altruism.
