# This workflow assumes a self hosted runner is set up with python and uv already. 
# This drastically increases the CI speed but at the cost of some pre-setup

# sudo apt install python3-pip pipx docker docker-compose openjdk-17-jdk
# pipx install uv
# pipx ensurepath
# sudo cp $(which uv) /usr/local/bin/uv
