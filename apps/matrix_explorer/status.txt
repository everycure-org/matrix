## Day 1: Getting Started

1. Project Structure Set Up:
   - Created basic folder structure for frontend and backend components in apps/matrix_explorer.
   - Initialized a React application for the frontend.
   - Set up a FastAPI application for the backend.

2. Technology Stack Finalized:
   - Frontend: React
   - Backend: FastAPI
   - Database: PostgreSQL

3. Backend Configuration:
   - Created main.py with basic FastAPI setup and CORS configuration.
   - Defined models.py with Pydantic and SQLAlchemy models for Drug-Disease pairs, KG Edges, and KG Nodes.
   - Set up requirements.in for package management using uv.

4. Docker Configuration:
   - Created a Dockerfile for the backend.
   - Set up docker-compose.yml to orchestrate backend and PostgreSQL services.

5. Next Steps:
   - Implement backend API endpoints for drug and disease searches.
   - Set up the PostgreSQL database and implement data models.
   - Begin development of the frontend UI components.

The project has a solid foundation, and we're ready to start implementing core functionality in the coming days.
