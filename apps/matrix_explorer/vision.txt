# Project Title: Interactive Drug-Disease Exploration Application

Description: This project aims to develop a high-performance interactive application that
allows users to explore a dataset of drug-disease pairs. The application will feature a
responsive UI with fuzzy search capabilities, enabling users to search for drugs and
diseases by name or ID. The application will cache data on the client side to enhance
performance and provide a seamless user experience. Future enhancements may include
displaying similar drugs and diseases based on node embeddings.
