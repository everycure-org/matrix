## Breaking Changes üõ†

No breaking changes were introduced in this release.


## Exciting New Features üéâ

- **Unified Integration Layer:**  A streamlined integration process for all data sources, simplifying the addition of new sources. This includes the integration of Spoke KG.
- **Sampling Mechanism:** Ability to run the pipeline on a sample of data for faster development and testing, providing more confidence in end-to-end pipeline execution.
- **K-fold Cross-Validation:** Updated pipeline trains multiple models on different data subsets to assess model stability and avoid lucky seeds.
- **Model Stability Metrics:** Extended pipeline evaluation provides model stability metrics, offering deeper insights into model robustness.
- **Grafana and Prometheus Deployment:** Enhanced monitoring of the Kubernetes cluster and experiments using Grafana and Prometheus for improved observability.
- **Improved Data Tracking:** Release history webpage provides detailed information about each data release, including datasets used. MLFlow now logs datasets.
- **Kedro Experiment:** New CLI command for running kedro pipelines and logging results to MLFlow. Allows for better organization and tracking of experiments.


## Experiments üß™

No new experiments were reported in this release.


## Bugfixes üêõ

- **Clinical Trial Preprocessing:** Resolved an issue in the clinical trial preprocessing, ensuring correct data handling.
- **Data Normalization Status:** Corrected the normalizer to accurately reflect `normalization_success` status.
- **MLflow Metric Tracking:** Fixed a problem in MLflow metric tracking, ensuring accurate recording.
- **Missing Edges:** Fixed a bug causing missing edges after deduplication in the integration pipeline.
- **Import Error:** Corrected an import error caused by branch drift.
- **Schema Error:** Resolved a schema error concerning null values in the `ingest_nodes` process.
- **Neo4j Connection Protocol:** Corrected the Neo4j connection protocol in the `wipe_neo` script.
- **Argo Release Trigger:** Resolved an issue with the trigger release label in Argo.
- **CLI Error Handling:** Improved error handling in the CLI to better display output during streaming.
- **Writing to Google Sheets:** Fixed issues with writing to Google Sheets for the SILC sheet.
