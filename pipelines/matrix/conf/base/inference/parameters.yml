# Below dicts would describe child classes of inferRun 
# which would be injected with object injector (similar to what we do
# with GDS algorithms for topological embeddings in feature/node2vec)
# each class would have slightly different operations than the remaining ones 
# i.e. different visualisations, different descriptive stats etc
