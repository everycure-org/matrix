# overriding the default compose for CI. Several reasons:
# 1) we override the neo4j image to Intel
# 2) override the images to avoid keeping state in CI (no data mount)
# 3) add an executino of the matrix-pipeline in a container to execute against the services defined in the base compose file 
services:
  # not executing the node-synonymizer in CI
  node-synonymizer: !reset null

  neo4j:
    # FUTURE: Newever container version gives issues, due to `apoc-extended`
    # and `gds` versions not being released yet. Update when released.
    # overwriting volumes so we don't have any
    # https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/merge/#reset-value
    volumes: !override 
      # note we do NOT mount data which makes the CI container stateless
