  drug_exception_list:
    # Diazoxide choline was approved in 2025; none of the KGs will have it within the near future so it currently maps to Diazoxide despite those two being distinct entities. This leads to duplicates -> pipeline throws error. Decision was made to keep it but to drop this specific duplicate
    - diazoxide choline
