It is not a primary disease on its own, nor is it a subtype of another disease; rather, it is a complication that arises specifically due to the iatrogenic effects of radiation treatment. Therefore, it fits the definition of a disease-iatrogenic/drug-induced.

It is not a subtype of another disease, nor is it caused by medical treatment or drug therapy. Vitiligo stands alone as a distinct condition with its own pathophysiology and clinical presentation.
vacuolar Neuromyopathy	['gene_therapy_candidate', 'drug_amenable']	{'gene_therapy_candidate': 'Some forms of vacuolar neuromyopathy are linked to genetic mutations that could be addressed through gene therapy approaches, such as gene replacement or editing.

It is characterized by the presence of vacuoles in muscle fibers and is often associated with specific underlying conditions, such as mitochondrial disorders or metabolic myopathies. Therefore, it is not a primary disease on its own but rather a specific manifestation within the broader context of neuromyopathies.
