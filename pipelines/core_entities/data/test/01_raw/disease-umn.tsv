vitiligo			3	Vitiligo affects approximately 0.5% to 2% of the global population, placing it in the intermediate category. This prevalence indicates that while it is not as common as diseases affecting over 1% of the population, it is also not rare, as it exceeds the threshold for rare diseases.	4	Vitiligo is a chronic skin condition characterized by the loss of pigment, and while some treatments may help restore color, they do not guarantee resolution. The duration post-diagnosis is typically lifelong, as the condition can persist for years and often requires ongoing management. Therefore, it is categorized as chronic.	3	Vitiligo primarily affects skin pigmentation, which can lead to significant psychological distress and social stigma, particularly in vulnerable populations. While it does not typically impair physical functioning or daily activities directly, the emotional and social consequences can lead to moderate to high morbidity in affected individuals. Therefore, categorizing vitiligo as a 3 (moderate morbidity) reflects its impact on quality of life and ADLs, especially in those who are more susceptible to the psychosocial effects of the condition.	1	Vitiligo is a skin condition characterized by the loss of pigment, leading to white patches on the skin. It is not associated with increased mortality, as it does not affect vital organ function or lead to life-threatening complications. Therefore, it falls into category 1, indicating no mortality, and there is currently no curative treatment available, which reinforces the need for further research and development in this area.	4	The current standard of care for vitiligo primarily includes topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and phototherapy, which aim to repigment the skin and improve appearance rather than cure the disease or prevent its progression. These treatments can lead to some repigmentation but do not address the underlying autoimmune mechanisms or prevent new lesions from forming, thus categorizing the modification as low disease modification.	2	The current standard of care for vitiligo, which includes topical corticosteroids and phototherapy, often results in moderate side effects such as skin irritation and photosensitivity, necessitating intervention to manage these symptoms. While lifestyle adjustments can help in managing the condition, they do not resolve the underlying pathophysiology, thus justifying a moderate categorization of side effects.	2	The current standard of care for vitiligo primarily includes topical corticosteroids and other prescription medications, which are administered orally in some cases, such as systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants. These treatments require a prescription due to their potential side effects and the need for medical supervision. Therefore, the appropriate categorization for the route of administration is 'prescription oral'.	4	The current standard of care for vitiligo primarily includes topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, which are typically applied once or twice daily, categorizing them as '4 = once per day'. This frequency is necessary to maintain therapeutic efficacy and manage the chronic nature of the disease, which can significantly impact the quality of life. Given that vitiligo is not a degenerative disease but rather an autoimmune condition, the frequency of administration reflects the need for consistent management rather than a high burden of treatment.	2	The current standard of care for vitiligo primarily includes topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and phototherapy, which generally fall within the range of $100 to $1000 per month. While some advanced treatments, such as systemic therapies or newer biologics, may increase costs, the majority of patients utilize more affordable topical treatments. Therefore, the overall cost to patients for managing vitiligo can be categorized as low.	3	The standard of care for vitiligo primarily includes topical corticosteroids and phototherapy, which are available in many countries but may not be universally accessible. Some treatments require specific equipment or conditions, such as phototherapy devices that necessitate a cold chain for certain formulations. Additionally, while there are multiple manufacturers, access can be inconsistent, particularly in low-resource settings.	1	Vitiligo is primarily treated with topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and phototherapy, which are available and licensed in multiple stringent regulatory regions, including the United States (FDA), European Union (EMA), and Japan (PMDA). The presence of these treatments in at least three stringent regulatory regions indicates a low barrier to acquiring the standard of care. Therefore, the regulatory barriers for vitiligo treatment are categorized as low.	15.0	[('QALY', 253), ('adverse_effects', 259), ('commonality', 266), ('cost_to_patients', 284), ('disease_modification', 240), ('duration', 238), ('frequency_of_administration', 241), ('mortality', 267), ('regulation_barriers', 279), ('robust_supply', 260), ('route_of_administration', 222)]	[('QALY', 104), ('adverse_effects', 82), ('commonality', 71), ('cost_to_patients', 95), ('disease_modification', 88), ('duration', 70), ('frequency_of_administration', 109), ('mortality', 89), ('regulation_barriers', 95), ('robust_supply', 81), ('route_of_administration', 83)]	MONDO:0008661
vacuolar Neuromyopathy	vacuolar Neuromyopathy; muscular dystrophy with rimmed vacuoles	(This entity is also known as vacuolar Neuromyopathy; muscular dystrophy with rimmed vacuoles)	4	Vacuolar Neuromyopathy, also known as muscular dystrophy with rimmed vacuoles, is classified as a rare disease due to its low prevalence and incidence rates, which are significantly below 1 in 100,000 individuals. The condition is characterized by specific histopathological findings and is not commonly diagnosed in the general population, indicating a limited unmet medical need compared to more prevalent neuromuscular disorders.	5	Vacuolar Neuromyopathy is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy due to the accumulation of vacuoles in muscle fibers, leading to a lifelong condition with no known cure or effective treatment to reverse the underlying pathology. The chronic nature of this disease results in persistent symptoms and disability, necessitating ongoing management and support. Therefore, it is categorized as lifelong, reflecting the unmet medical need for effective therapeutic interventions.	4	Vacuolar Neuromyopathy significantly impairs muscle function, leading to progressive weakness and disability that severely affects activities of daily living (ADLs) such as mobility, self-care, and communication. The disease's impact is not limited to vulnerable populations, as it can affect individuals across various demographics, resulting in high morbidity. Therefore, categorizing this condition as a 4 reflects its substantial burden on quality of life and daily functioning.	5	Vacuolar Neuromyopathy, characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, has a very poor prognosis, with studies indicating a 5-year survival rate significantly below 20% in advanced cases. The absence of curative treatments further exacerbates the mortality associated with this condition, leading to a categorization of very high mortality. Therefore, it is appropriate to assign a score of 5, reflecting both the high mortality rate and the lack of effective therapeutic options.	5	Current standard of care for vacuolar neuromyopathy primarily focuses on symptomatic management, including physical therapy and supportive care, as there are no curative treatments or significant disease-modifying therapies available. The disease is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, and while interventions can help improve quality of life, they do not alter the underlying disease progression. Therefore, the modification provided by current treatments falls into the category of symptom relief only.	4	Vacuolar Neuromyopathy is associated with significant muscle weakness and progressive disability, leading to serious symptoms that often require medical intervention. The current standard of care primarily focuses on supportive therapies, as there is no definitive cure, and the disease can lead to severe complications affecting respiratory and cardiac function. While some lifestyle adjustments may help manage symptoms, the overall severity of the disease and the need for ongoing medical care justify a categorization of very serious symptoms requiring intervention.	2	The current standard of care for vacuolar neuromyopathy primarily involves supportive treatments and management of symptoms, which often includes prescription oral medications such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants to manage inflammation and muscle weakness. These medications are not available over the counter and require a prescription from a healthcare provider, thus categorizing them as prescription oral.	2	Vacuolar Neuromyopathy, characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, currently lacks a definitive treatment, with management primarily focused on supportive care and symptomatic relief. Given the degenerative nature of the disease and the absence of effective disease-modifying therapies, the frequency of administration for any supportive interventions or symptomatic treatments is typically low, often falling into the category of once per month or less. Therefore, the unmet medical need is significant, warranting a categorization of 2 for the frequency of current standard care administration.	4	The current standard of care for vacuolar neuromyopathy primarily involves supportive therapies and symptomatic management, which can include physical therapy, pain management, and potentially expensive medications for associated symptoms. Given the complexity and chronic nature of the disease, the cumulative costs of these interventions can easily reach the high category, particularly when considering the need for ongoing care and potential hospitalization.	5	The supply chain for the standard of care for vacuolar neuromyopathy is categorized as 5 = very low due to its rarity and the limited number of specialized treatments available, which are often produced by a single manufacturer. This results in frequent stock-outs and significant accessibility issues, particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, the lack of widespread awareness and research funding further exacerbates the challenges in ensuring a reliable supply chain for affected patients.	5	Vacuolar Neuromyopathy, also known as muscular dystrophy with rimmed vacuoles, currently lacks specific licensed treatments in any stringent regulatory authority region, including the FDA in the United States and the EMA in Europe. The absence of approved therapies means that management is primarily supportive and off-label, leading to significant unmet medical need. Therefore, the regulatory barriers to acquiring a standard of care for this condition are categorized as high.	24.5	[('QALY', 279), ('adverse_effects', 285), ('commonality', 292), ('cost_to_patients', 310), ('disease_modification', 266), ('duration', 264), ('frequency_of_administration', 267), ('mortality', 293), ('regulation_barriers', 305), ('robust_supply', 286), ('route_of_administration', 248)]	[('QALY', 94), ('adverse_effects', 100), ('commonality', 93), ('cost_to_patients', 81), ('disease_modification', 96), ('duration', 92), ('frequency_of_administration', 112), ('mortality', 102), ('regulation_barriers', 94), ('robust_supply', 95), ('route_of_administration', 77)]	MONDO:0011155
radiation cystitis	irradiation cystitis	(This entity is also known as irradiation cystitis)	2	Radiation cystitis, a complication following pelvic radiation therapy, primarily affects patients undergoing treatment for cancers such as prostate or cervical cancer. Its incidence is estimated to occur in approximately 5-10% of patients receiving radiation therapy, categorizing it as a common condition rather than very common or rare. Therefore, it is classified as category 2, indicating it is common among those exposed to relevant treatments.	4	Radiation cystitis typically manifests as a delayed complication of pelvic radiation therapy, often presenting weeks to months after treatment. While some cases may resolve with conservative management or treatment, many patients experience persistent symptoms that can last for years, indicating a chronic nature of the condition. Therefore, it is categorized as chronic (4) due to the potential for long-term complications and the limited effectiveness of available treatments.	4	Radiation cystitis significantly impacts quality of life due to symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, and pain, which can severely hinder daily activities and social interactions. The condition often leads to chronic complications, requiring ongoing management and potentially resulting in high morbidity for affected individuals. Therefore, it is categorized as 4 = high morbidity, reflecting its substantial impact on activities of daily living for a considerable number of patients, not limited to vulnerable populations.	1	Radiation cystitis primarily causes morbidity rather than mortality, as it is a complication of radiation therapy that leads to bladder inflammation and dysfunction rather than direct life-threatening conditions. The condition is generally manageable with symptomatic treatments, and while it can significantly impact quality of life, it does not have a 5-year survival rate associated with mortality. Therefore, it is categorized as having no mortality.	5	Current standard of care for radiation cystitis primarily focuses on symptom relief through interventions such as bladder instillations, medications, and supportive care, rather than addressing the underlying pathophysiology or preventing the progression of the disease. While these treatments can alleviate discomfort and improve quality of life, they do not modify the disease course or provide a curative solution. Therefore, the modification of radiation cystitis by current therapies is categorized as symptom relief only.	3	Radiation cystitis typically presents with serious symptoms such as hematuria, urinary frequency, and urgency, which often require medical intervention such as medications or procedures to manage. While some lifestyle adjustments may alleviate symptoms, the severity of the condition and the need for intervention categorize it as serious. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate, reflecting the need for treatment due to the significant impact on quality of life.	2	The current standard of care for radiation cystitis primarily involves the use of oral medications such as pentosan polysulfate sodium, which is a prescription oral agent. This treatment aims to alleviate symptoms and promote healing of the bladder lining affected by radiation. Other interventions may include bladder instillations or surgical options, but the primary pharmacological management falls under prescription oral medications.	4	The current standard of care for radiation cystitis primarily involves symptomatic management, including the use of medications such as analgesics, anticholinergics, and occasionally intravesical therapies. These treatments are typically administered on a daily basis to manage symptoms effectively, particularly in cases of severe discomfort or bleeding. Therefore, the frequency of administration aligns with category 4, indicating that treatment is administered once per day to ensure optimal symptom control and improve quality of life for affected patients.	2	The standard of care for radiation cystitis primarily includes medications such as analgesics, anticholinergics, and topical treatments, which typically fall within the range of generic prescription medicines. While some patients may require more intensive management or interventions, the overall cost for most patients remains within the low category, generally not exceeding $1,000 per month.	4	The standard of care for radiation cystitis primarily involves symptomatic management with medications such as analgesics, anticholinergics, and topical agents, which are not uniformly available across all countries. Additionally, some treatments may rely on specific formulations or manufacturers, leading to reliability issues and limited access in certain regions. Consequently, the supply chain for these treatments is categorized as low due to these constraints.	5	Radiation cystitis is primarily managed with supportive care and off-label use of medications such as pentosan polysulfate sodium, which is not specifically approved for this indication by major regulatory authorities. Currently, there is no specific treatment licensed for radiation cystitis in any stringent regulatory region, including the FDA in the United States or the EMA in Europe, indicating a lack of formal approval for a standard of care. Therefore, the difficulty to acquire the standard of care for radiation cystitis is categorized as high due to the absence of licensed treatments in any stringent authority region.	18.5	[('QALY', 264), ('adverse_effects', 270), ('commonality', 277), ('cost_to_patients', 295), ('disease_modification', 251), ('duration', 249), ('frequency_of_administration', 252), ('mortality', 278), ('regulation_barriers', 290), ('robust_supply', 271), ('route_of_administration', 233)]	[('QALY', 95), ('adverse_effects', 91), ('commonality', 88), ('cost_to_patients', 79), ('disease_modification', 98), ('duration', 87), ('frequency_of_administration', 102), ('mortality', 85), ('regulation_barriers', 120), ('robust_supply', 87), ('route_of_administration', 82)]	MONDO:0004112
12q14 microdeletion syndrome	osteopoikilosis-short stature-intellectual disability syndrome; monosomy 12q14; Del(12)(q14); deletion 12q14	(This entity is also known as osteopoikilosis-short stature-intellectual disability syndrome; monosomy 12q14; Del(12)(q14); deletion 12q14)	4	12q14 microdeletion syndrome is classified as a rare genetic disorder, with an estimated prevalence of less than 1 in 100,000 individuals. The limited number of reported cases and the specific nature of the genetic deletion contribute to its categorization as rare. Given the low incidence and the specialized nature of the condition, it does not meet the criteria for common or very common diseases.	5	12q14 microdeletion syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by a range of symptoms including short stature, intellectual disability, and osteopoikilosis, which are typically lifelong and do not have a curative treatment. The nature of genetic syndromes often leads to chronic management of symptoms rather than resolution, placing this condition in the lifelong category. Therefore, the duration post-diagnosis is categorized as 5 = lifelong due to the persistent and unresolvable nature of the genetic abnormalities involved.	4	12q14 microdeletion syndrome is associated with significant developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and physical anomalies, which can severely impact an individual's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). The presence of short stature and potential skeletal abnormalities further complicates mobility and self-care, leading to a high degree of morbidity. Therefore, this condition is categorized as having high morbidity, scoring a 4, due to its substantial impact on quality of life and independence in affected individuals.	1	12q14 microdeletion syndrome is characterized by a range of clinical features including short stature, intellectual disability, and osteopoikilosis, but it does not typically lead to high mortality rates. The available literature indicates that individuals with this syndrome can have a normal life expectancy, and while they may face significant health challenges, these do not generally result in death. Therefore, the condition can be categorized as having no appreciable mortality, leading to a score of 1.	5	The current standard of care for 12q14 microdeletion syndrome primarily focuses on managing symptoms associated with the condition, such as intellectual disability and skeletal abnormalities, rather than addressing the underlying genetic cause. There are no curative or disease-modifying treatments available, and interventions are largely supportive, aimed at improving quality of life. Therefore, this condition falls into the category of 'symptom relief only'.	2	The current standard of care for 12q14 microdeletion syndrome primarily focuses on managing symptoms such as short stature and intellectual disability, which can lead to moderate symptoms requiring intervention, such as physical therapy or educational support. While lifestyle adjustments can help manage some aspects of the condition, the need for ongoing intervention indicates a moderate level of side effects associated with the syndrome's management.	2	The current standard of care for 12q14 microdeletion syndrome primarily involves managing symptoms and associated conditions, which often requires prescription medications for issues such as growth hormone deficiency or other endocrine disorders. These medications are typically administered orally and require a prescription due to their specific indications and potential side effects. Therefore, the route of administration is categorized as prescription oral.	1	Current management of 12q14 microdeletion syndrome primarily focuses on symptomatic treatment and supportive care, as there is no specific pharmacological therapy approved for this condition. Interventions may include physical therapy, educational support, and monitoring for associated complications, which do not require regular medication administration. Therefore, the frequency of administration of the current standard of care can be categorized as '1 = once only', as most interventions are not medication-based and are provided as needed rather than on a regular schedule.	2	The current standard of care for 12q14 microdeletion syndrome primarily involves supportive therapies and management of symptoms, which typically include physical therapy, educational support, and regular monitoring for associated health issues. These interventions generally incur costs that fall within the low range, as they often utilize generic medications and services rather than high-cost specialty drugs or biologics. Therefore, the categorization of the cost to patients is assessed as low, reflecting the affordability of the necessary care.	5	The standard of care for 12q14 microdeletion syndrome is primarily supportive and symptomatic, with no specific treatments widely available. This condition is rare, leading to a very limited number of healthcare providers familiar with it, and consequently, the necessary resources and interventions are often only available in a few specialized centers. As a result, the supply chain for care is characterized by frequent stock-outs and reliance on a limited number of manufacturers, placing it in the very low category.	5	12q14 microdeletion syndrome currently lacks specific licensed treatments in any stringent regulatory authority regions, such as the FDA in the United States or the EMA in Europe. The management of this condition primarily involves supportive care and off-label use of therapies, which indicates a significant unmet medical need.

The limited number of reported cases and the specific nature of the genetic anomaly contribute to its categorization as rare, as it does not meet the thresholds for common or very common diseases.	5	12p12.1 microdeletion syndrome is a genetic condition resulting from the deletion of a portion of chromosome 12, leading to a range of developmental and health issues. The effects of this syndrome are typically lifelong, as it involves permanent genetic changes that cannot be reversed or cured, and management focuses on supportive care rather than resolution of the underlying condition. Therefore, the duration category for this syndrome is classified as 5 = lifelong.	4	12p12.1 microdeletion syndrome is associated with significant developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and various physical anomalies, which can severely impact an individual's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). The presence of these challenges typically results in high morbidity, as affected individuals often require extensive support and care throughout their lives. Therefore, this condition is categorized as having a score of 4, indicating high morbidity due to its profound effects on quality of life and daily functioning.	2	12p12.1 microdeletion syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disability, and various physical anomalies. While the syndrome can lead to significant health challenges, the overall mortality associated with this condition is not well-documented, and many individuals can survive into adulthood with appropriate care and support. Given the lack of curative treatment and the relatively low incidence of mortality directly attributable to the syndrome, it is categorized as having low mortality (score 2).	5	Current management of 12p12.1 microdeletion syndrome primarily focuses on symptomatic treatment and supportive care, as there is no curative or disease-modifying therapy available. Interventions may include educational support, physical therapy, and management of associated health issues, which do not alter the underlying genetic condition. Therefore, the modification provided by the standard of care is categorized as symptom relief only.	2	The current standard of care for 12p12.1 microdeletion syndrome primarily focuses on supportive therapies and management of associated symptoms, which can include developmental delays and various physical anomalies. While these interventions may lead to moderate symptoms requiring intervention, they do not typically result in serious or life-threatening side effects. Therefore, the categorization is 2, as the symptoms are moderate and require intervention but are manageable with appropriate care and lifestyle adjustments.	4	The current standard of care for 12p12.1 microdeletion syndrome primarily involves supportive therapies and management of associated symptoms, which typically do not require specific pharmacological treatments. As such, there is no established medication that is routinely prescribed or administered for this condition, leading to the conclusion that the route of administration does not fit into the categories of oral or injectable medications. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization is '4 = surgical procedure', as interventions may include surgical options for associated congenital anomalies, although these are not universally applicable to all patients.	2	The current standard of care for 12p12.1 microdeletion syndrome primarily involves supportive therapies and management of associated symptoms rather than a specific pharmacological treatment regimen. As such, interventions may occur on a monthly basis or less frequently, depending on the individual needs of the patient and the specific symptoms being addressed, which aligns with a categorization of 'once per month (or less)'.	3	The current standard of care for 12p12.1 microdeletion syndrome primarily involves supportive therapies and management of associated symptoms, which can include various specialist consultations, therapies, and medications. While these costs can vary significantly based on individual patient needs and geographic location, they typically aggregate to a moderate range, often exceeding $1,000 per month when considering the cumulative expenses of ongoing care and interventions.	5	The standard of care for 12p12.1 microdeletion syndrome is primarily supportive and symptomatic, with no specific treatments widely available. This condition is rare, leading to a very limited number of healthcare providers familiar with it, and consequently, the necessary resources and interventions are often only available in a few specialized centers.

11p15.4 microduplication syndrome	dup(11)p(15.4); trisomy 11p15.4	(This entity is also known as dup(11)p(15.4); trisomy 11p15.4)	4	11p15.4 microduplication syndrome is classified as a rare genetic disorder, with an estimated prevalence of less than 1 in 100,000 individuals. The limited number of reported cases in the literature and its association with specific genetic anomalies further support its categorization as rare. Given these factors, it is appropriate to assign this condition to category 4 (rare).	5	11p15.4 microduplication syndrome is a genetic condition resulting from the duplication of a specific region on chromosome 11, leading to a range of developmental and health issues. Given that this syndrome is caused by chromosomal abnormalities, it typically results in lifelong challenges, including developmental delays and potential physical health issues, with no definitive cure or standard treatment that can resolve the underlying genetic cause. Therefore, the duration of this condition post-diagnosis is categorized as lifelong (5).	4	11p15.4 microduplication syndrome is associated with significant developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and various physical health issues, which can severely impact an individual's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). The presence of these challenges typically results in high morbidity, as affected individuals often require extensive support and intervention to manage their daily needs. Therefore, this condition is categorized as having a score of 4, indicating high morbidity due to its profound effects on quality of life and independence.	2	11p15.4 microduplication syndrome is associated with a range of developmental and health issues, including growth retardation, intellectual disability, and various congenital anomalies. While the syndrome can lead to significant morbidity, the available literature indicates that it does not typically result in high mortality rates, with most affected individuals surviving into adulthood, albeit with varying degrees of health complications. Therefore, this condition can be categorized as having low mortality (score 2), as it does not lead to death in the majority of cases and there is currently no curative treatment available.	5	The current standard of care for 11p15.4 microduplication syndrome primarily focuses on symptom management and supportive therapies, as there is no curative treatment available. Interventions may include developmental support, educational accommodations, and management of associated health issues, which do not modify the underlying genetic condition. Therefore, the modification of the disease is categorized as symptom relief only.	3	The current standard of care for 11p15.4 microduplication syndrome primarily focuses on managing symptoms, which can include developmental delays, growth abnormalities, and potential metabolic issues. While some symptoms may be alleviated through lifestyle adjustments, the presence of serious symptoms such as significant developmental challenges necessitates intervention, categorizing the side effects as serious and requiring intervention.	2	The current standard of care for 11p15.4 microduplication syndrome primarily involves supportive therapies and management of associated symptoms, which often require prescription medications. These medications are typically administered orally and are not available over the counter, thus categorizing them as prescription oral. There are no established injectable or surgical interventions specifically targeting the genetic condition itself.	2	The current standard of care for 11p15.4 microduplication syndrome primarily involves supportive therapies and management of associated symptoms rather than a specific pharmacological treatment regimen. As such, interventions may occur on a monthly basis or less frequently, depending on the individual patient's needs and the specific symptoms being addressed, which aligns with a categorization of 'once per month (or less)'. This infrequent administration reflects the lack of targeted therapies and the need for ongoing assessment rather than continuous treatment.	2	The current standard of care for 11p15.4 microduplication syndrome primarily involves supportive therapies and management of associated symptoms, which typically incur costs in the range of $100 to $1000 per month. These costs may include regular consultations with specialists, physical therapy, and medications for symptom management, but do not generally involve high-cost treatments such as biologics or gene therapies. Therefore, the categorization of 'low' is appropriate given the nature of the care required.	5	The standard of care for 11p15.4 microduplication syndrome primarily involves supportive therapies and management of associated symptoms, rather than a specific medication or treatment that is widely available. As a result, the resources and interventions are often limited to specialized centers, with significant variability in access across different regions. This leads to a categorization of very low robustness in the supply chain, as availability is restricted to a few countries, often relying on a limited number of providers.	5	11p15.4 microduplication syndrome currently lacks a specific licensed treatment in any stringent regulatory authority region, including the FDA in the United States, EMA in Europe, and PMDA in Japan. The management of this condition is primarily supportive and symptomatic, with no approved therapies, indicating that the standard of care is not formally recognized or licensed. Therefore, the regulatory barriers to acquiring standard care for this syndrome are categorized as high.	20.25	[('QALY', 283), ('adverse_effects', 289), ('commonality', 296), ('cost_to_patients', 314), ('disease_modification', 270), ('duration', 268), ('frequency_of_administration', 271), ('mortality', 297), ('regulation_barriers', 309), ('robust_supply', 290), ('route_of_administration', 252)]	[('QALY', 105), ('adverse_effects', 82), ('commonality', 84), ('cost_to_patients', 105), ('disease_modification', 83), ('duration', 105), ('frequency_of_administration', 107), ('mortality', 119), ('regulation_barriers', 94), ('robust_supply', 103), ('route_of_administration', 78)]	MONDO:0017580
10q22.3q23.3 microduplication syndrome	trisomy 10q22.3q23.3; dup(10)(q22.3q23.3)	(This entity is also known as trisomy 10q22.3q23.3; dup(10)(q22.3q23.3))	4	10q22.3q23.3 microduplication syndrome is classified as a rare genetic disorder, with an estimated prevalence of less than 1 in 100,000 individuals. The limited number of reported cases in the literature and the specific nature of the genetic anomaly contribute to its categorization as rare. Given the low incidence and the specialized nature of the condition, it does not meet the criteria for more common categories.	5	10q22.3q23.3 microduplication syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disability, and various physical anomalies, which typically persist throughout an individual's life. Given the nature of genetic disorders, there is no definitive treatment that can resolve the underlying genetic abnormalities, leading to a lifelong impact on affected individuals. Therefore, this condition is categorized as lifelong (5).	4	10q22.3q23.3 microduplication syndrome is associated with a range of developmental and physical disabilities, including intellectual disability, speech delays, and various congenital anomalies, which significantly impair activities of daily living (ADLs). The presence of these challenges in affected individuals leads to a substantial reduction in quality of life and increased care needs, categorizing the syndrome as having high morbidity. Therefore, the appropriate categorization for this condition is 4, indicating high morbidity due to its profound impact on daily functioning and overall quality of life.	2	10q22.3q23.3 microduplication syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disability, and various physical anomalies. While specific mortality data is limited, the syndrome is associated with significant morbidity and complications that can impact life expectancy, but it does not typically result in high mortality rates. Therefore, it is categorized as having low mortality (score 2), as there is no curative treatment available and the majority of affected individuals can survive into adulthood with appropriate care.	5	The current standard of care for 10q22.3q23.3 microduplication syndrome primarily focuses on symptomatic management and supportive therapies, as there is no curative treatment or high disease-modifying interventions available. Patients often require multidisciplinary care to address developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and other associated symptoms, which aligns with a categorization of symptom relief only. Therefore, the unmet medical need remains significant, as the underlying genetic condition cannot be modified or reversed.	3	The current standard of care for 10q22.3q23.3 microduplication syndrome primarily focuses on symptomatic management, as there is no definitive cure. Patients often experience serious symptoms such as developmental delays, intellectual disability, and various physical anomalies, which require intervention. While some aspects of the condition may be managed with lifestyle adjustments, the overall severity of symptoms necessitates serious medical intervention.	1	The current standard of care for 10q22.3q23.3 microduplication syndrome primarily involves supportive therapies and management of associated symptoms, which often include developmental delays and other health issues. These supportive treatments typically include over-the-counter medications for symptomatic relief, such as pain relievers or supplements, rather than prescription medications or invasive procedures. Therefore, the route of administration can be categorized as over the counter oral.	2	Current management of 10q22.3q23.3 microduplication syndrome primarily involves supportive care and symptomatic treatment rather than a specific pharmacological intervention, as there is no established standard of care that requires frequent administration. Therefore, the frequency of administration can be categorized as 'once per month (or less)' since interventions are typically based on individual symptoms and may not require regular dosing. This reflects the low unmet medical need for a specific treatment regimen in this genetic condition.	2	The current standard of care for 10q22.3q23.3 microduplication syndrome primarily involves supportive therapies and management of associated symptoms, which typically include physical therapy, speech therapy, and educational support. These interventions, while essential, generally incur costs that fall within the range of $100 to $1,000 per month, depending on the specific therapies utilized and the frequency of services required. Therefore, the cost to patients can be categorized as low.	5	The standard of care for 10q22.3q23.3 microduplication syndrome primarily involves supportive therapies and management of associated symptoms, which are not universally available and often depend on specialized healthcare providers. There is a lack of specific treatments or medications approved for this rare genetic condition, leading to a situation where resources are limited to a few countries with specialized centers. Consequently, the supply chain is characterized by very low availability, with frequent stock-outs and reliance on a limited number of manufacturers.	5	10q22.3q23.3 microduplication syndrome currently lacks specific licensed treatments in any stringent regulatory authority regions, such as the FDA in the United States or the EMA in Europe. Management typically involves supportive care and off-label use of various therapies, which indicates a high unmet medical need and regulatory barriers.
