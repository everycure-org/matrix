## 1. Always add the following note to the code you generate:
```
# NOTE: This <file/function/class> was partially generated using AI assistance.
```

Adjust the comment style to the language generated. This way we let people know the file
was generated, which helps reviewing it with a different lens (i.e. not relying on a
senior colleague having put a lot of thought into it but being a bit more critical /
reflecting about it)


## Coding style

- We use Google style python docstrings
- we use pytest for testing
- we use pyspark for large scale data preprocessing
- our pipeline leverages kedro for structuring our code
- we use pandera for data validation
- we use fastapi for API building
- we use pydantic for data validation and settings management
- we use uv for building and packaging
- we like functional programming 
- we love performance and use joblib to cache expensive functions (.cache folder by default)
- when writing unit tests, organise the test in a "GivenWhenThen" format, making the purpose of the test explicit
- when writing unit tests, do not generate unit tests that hardly test anything of value. Only generate them when the full test is clean, intuitive and valuable. Else just generate a stub describing what to test so the developer completes the test themselves. 
- comments should never describe _changes_ to the code, but _why_ behind the changes. When editing code, do not add comments explaining a change between two versions but only use comments to explain a broader _why_ of the code _as it is_ now.

## LiteLLM provider changes

- When adding or editing LiteLLM providers, follow `docs/src/infrastructure/LiteLLM-New-Provider-Guide.md` so secrets, ExternalSecret mappings, and `proxy_config.model_list` stay in sync.
