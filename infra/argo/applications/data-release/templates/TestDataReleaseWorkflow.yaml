# This is a dummy workflow template used only as a blueprint for testing the data-release-eventsource.
# It lets us quickly test our data-release feature with instant feedback loop.
# It simulates the successful completion of the data release pipeline.
# 
# It can be triggered by:
# argo submit --from workflowtemplate/test-data-release-template --labels git_sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
# 
# This will automatically create a workflow with a unique name like "test-data-release-template-abcde",
# so you don't need to delete previous workflows before running it again.
#
# Outcome - one PR will be created. When this PR is merged, a github action will run.
# Once you are done testing, don't forget to remove the git tag, github release, git branch and revert the PR that was merged.
