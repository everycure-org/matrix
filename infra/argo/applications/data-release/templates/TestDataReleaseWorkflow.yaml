# This is a dummy workflow used only as a trigger for the build-data-release-eventsource.
# It lets us quickly test our data-release feature with instant feedback loop.
# It simulates the successful completion of the data release pipeline.
# It can be triggered by:
# argo submit TestDataReleaseWorkflow.yaml --labels git_sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
# Outcome - one PR will be created. When this PR is merged, a github action will run.
# Once you are done testing, don't forget to remove the git tag, github release, git branch and revert the PR that was merged.
