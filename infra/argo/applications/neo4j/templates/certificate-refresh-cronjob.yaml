# This CronJob addresses the issue of Neo4j not automatically reloading SSL certificates
# after they are renewed by cert-manager. It performs a weekly restart of the Neo4j pod
# every Sunday at 2:00 AM to ensure that any renewed certificates are properly loaded.
# The job includes necessary RBAC permissions to execute commands within the Neo4j pod.
#
# Problem: Neo4j does not detect renewed SSL certificates without a restart
# Solution: Weekly automated restart via CronJob to ensure certificate updates are applied
